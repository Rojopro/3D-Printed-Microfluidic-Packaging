# 3D-Printed-Microfluidic-Packaging
This repository present files needed to print 3D devices used in reusable microfluidics, Lab-on-Chip and Organ-on-Chip applications, with respect to observability, electrical connections and optional horizontal fluidic inputs.

## Presentation
Considering the present sanitary crisis, it is now mandatory to create systems capable of assisting health professionals in our struggle against Covid-19.
One of the means to do so for engineers is to conceive tools to facilitate early detection of contaminations, wich are easy to use and reliable.
Thus this prototype was conceived as a mean to test the usability of localy conceived chips.
